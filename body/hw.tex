\begin{block}{}
Curate a list of topological descriptors.  For each, we are looking for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Name of descriptor
\item Short explanation (very short)
\item Reference to where first used (if possible)
\item Pros: What is it good for?
\item Cons: Where / when is it insufficient?
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\todo{Sam, can you create a wiki page for this that perhaps they can edit
directly as we are in class during the second day?}
